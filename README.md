# gra-ui

React components for interfaces that need a little more personality than strictly necessary.

`@gregory-artaud/gra-ui` is a React 19 component library built by composing shadcn/ui primitives. It ships typed ESM and CommonJS bundles with a standalone compiled stylesheet, so consuming applications do not need Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @gregory-artaud/gra-ui
```

Import the component styles once in your application:

```tsx
import "@gregory-artaud/gra-ui/styles.css";
```

## IndecisiveButton

`IndecisiveButton` cycles through possible decisions while it is hovered or focused, then reports whichever option was visible when it was clicked.

```tsx
import { IndecisiveButton } from "@gregory-artaud/gra-ui";
import "@gregory-artaud/gra-ui/styles.css";

export function Decision() {
  return (
    <IndecisiveButton
      choices={["Ship it", "Wait a minute", "Ship it anyway"]}
      onDecision={(choice) => console.log(choice)}
    >
      Decide
    </IndecisiveButton>
  );
}
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:docs
```

Available quality checks deliberately exclude tests:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm build:docs
```
